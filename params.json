Some of the more interesting parts of the course:\r\n- [tic-tac-toe](jscourse/tictactoe/index.html)\r\n- [minesweeper](jscourse/minesweeper/index.html)\r\n- [missile command](jscourse/missile-command/index.html) - a work in progress canvas implementation of the old Missile Command game, with the ability to save and replay previous games (for a high scores list).\r\n\r\n### Reactive Extensions workshop\r\n\r\nIn 2015, I gave a [workshop on the Reactive Extensions framework](wwc-rx-workshop), using the [Rxjs](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) version of the library. The workshop built a [live, real-time dashboard](wwc-rx-workshop/workshop/twitter_dashboard.html) providing analysis on a stream of tweets.\r\n\r\nI've worked with the Reactive Extensions library for over 5 years. I think it's a powerful tool well suited to modern asynchronous and streaming applications which are becoming more and more common.\r\n\r\nTo provide a good demonstration for the workshop, I recorded tweets during the Cricket World Cup semi final match between Australia and India. I used the VirtualScheduler in Rx to replay the tweet stream as if it is live, which also allows the replay of the stream to be sped up.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
